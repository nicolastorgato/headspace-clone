# Headspace Website Clone

I created a website clone of the famous meditation app, [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/).
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Libraries & Tools:
- [React JS](https://it.reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:  `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
